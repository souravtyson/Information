Session Management:::

url: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1453560/c-sharp-keep-session-id-over-httpwebrequest

1.) session tracking- involves session id is maintained across multiple requests to the server.this means that each time
a given client makes a request to the server it passes the same session id.

2.) Cookies- the server asks the client to store a cookie by setting the set-cookie http response header.this cookie contains the unique session id assigned to that client.cookie is then sent back to the server by the client using the cookie http request header on each request and thus the server is informed on each request the session id currently assigned to the client.

3.)URL rewriting- session id is sent somewhere in the url.Server extracts the session id from the url so that it can lookup the session for a particular client.the server must also make sure that any URLs in the web pages sent back to the client are also rewritten to contain that particular clients session ID. As the session ID is encoded in the URLs, this method of session tracking is transparent to the browser. Often a server will resort to URL rewriting if it finds it is unable to set a session cookie on the client - implying that the client does not support/allow cookies.
Note that sessions can expire. This means that if the server does not 'see' a given session ID for a period of time, it may remove the session data to preserve resources.


*******************************************

If you have an iis hosted site,it expects a session id inside a cookie named ASP.NET_SessionId(or on the request string). if you have a java servlet engine on the other side,it expects a cookie called JSESSIONID(or a request path parameter jsessionid).

ASP : stands for Active Server Pages
user controls in asp.net can be written in different languages, including C++ and java. when a browser requests an asp.net file, the asp.net engine reads a file, compiles and executes the scripts in the file, and returns the result to the browser as plain HTML.

1. ASP.NET files have the file extension .aspx
2. ASP.NET file with Razor C# syntax have the file extension .cshtml
3. ASP.NET files with Razor VB syntax have the file extension .vbhtml

ASP.NET supports three different development methods: Web Pages,MVC(Model View Controller),& web forms.

Razor : 
1. It is a markup syntax for adding server-based code to web pages.
2. It is a server side markup syntax much like ASP and PHP.

Logical Folder Structure : 

Account folder - contains logon and security files
App_Data folder - contains databases and data files
Images folder - contains images
Scripts folder - contains browser scripts
Shared - contains common files(like layout, style files)


******************************************

Ubuntu:
	command : pwd - print working directory : if you want to know that in which dirctory you are currently in,then write this command.
	* in linux sometimes the hidden files are called dot files.
	command : ls : list of files and folder that are present in the current working directory.
	command : ls -l : list of files and folder that are present in the current working directory with details.
	command : ls -a : list of files and folder that are present in the current working directory(files that are hidden also can be visible).
	command : cat : used to read the contents of the file.
	command : clear : clean the whole terminal.
	command : ls -la : list of normal and hidden files and folder with details in current working directory.
	command : cd - change directory - if you want to change the directory(want to get inside the folder) then use this command followed by the folder name you want to get inside.
	command : cd .. : if you want to move to the previous directory then use this command.
	command : mkdir - make directory : this creates a folder.
	command : rmdir - remove directory: this removes the folder.
	command : touch - this creates a file.
	command : rm - removes : this removes the file.
	command : cp - copy : takes two argument, first argument is the old file name,second argument is new file name.data of the old file name is copied to the data of new file name.
	command : mv - move : takes two argument. first argument is for old file,second argument is for the folder in which it is supposed to be moved(if you want to move the file with specified name,then that can also be possible or you can move the file without modifing the file name).
	command : grep : search a file for any specific keyword.takes two argument. first argument is the keyword which is supposed to be searched,second argument is the name of a file in which the keyword is to be searched.
	command : diff : (difference between the two files)compare two files.takes two argument.the two argument is the file name.
	command : passwd : changing the password.
	command : echo : prints aline of text.
	command : info : provides the detail information of the command : > - greater than : if you want to write the output of command which is written  on the terminal then use greater than symbol
	For example: ls -l > Bacon
	where Bacon is the file name in which the output of ls -l is written.The only problem is that, whenever you try to write into the file overridden occurs and old data which was written is deleted. So if you want to append into the same file then use ">>" in place of ">"
	
	* File Permission : Is the file present in the system is readable,can be editable and executable, can be found with following commands
	r = it says file can be read.
	w = file can be editted
	x = file can be executed
	
	Now when you write the command ls -l you get details of the file and one of the detail is file permission.
	
	For Example : -rwx rw- r--
	-rwx - this is for owner of the file.
	rw - this is for group.
	r-- - this is for every other persons.

	* Change the permission of a file : 
		u-user
		g-group
		o-other people(from outside world)
		
		chmod 754 Bacon
		
		7,5,4 represents the individual permissions for (in this order) user, group,other
		
		4 - stands for read
		2 - stands for write
		1 - stands for execute
		0 - stands for no permission

		7 - comes from 4+2+1(user has all permissions)
		5 - comes from 4+1(group has read and execute permission)

Liveness : 
	A concurrent applications ability to execute in a timely manner is known as liveness
Deadlock : 
	Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other.
Starvation : 
	Starvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to make progress. This happens when shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by "greedy" threads. For example, suppose an object provides a synchronized method that often takes a long time to return. If one thread invokes this method frequently, other threads that also need frequent synchronized access to the same object will often be blocked.
Livelock : 
	A thread often acts in response to the action of another thread. If the other thread's action is also a response to the action of another thread, then livelock may result. As with deadlock, livelocked threads are unable to make further progress. However, the threads are not blocked — they are simply too busy responding to each other to resume work. This is comparable to two people attempting to pass each other in a corridor: Alphonse moves to his left to let Gaston pass, while Gaston moves to his right to let Alphonse pass. Seeing that they are still blocking each other, Alphone moves to his right, while Gaston moves to his left. They're still blocking each other.

ubuntu command : 
zip command : if you want to zip(extension=.gz) some file you have to use the command "gzip"
	EXAMPLE : gzip <filename>
unzip command : if you want to unzip the file you have to use command "gunzip"
	EXAMPLE : gunzip <filename>
compressing multiple files command : if you want to compress multiple files into one .tar files then you can use "tar" command
	EXAMPLE : tar cvf <file_name.tar> file1 file2 ---- filen
		here cvf stands for create, notification that what have occured, filename

uncompressing the tar : if you want to uncompress the .tar file then you can do it in following way 
	EXAMPLE : tar xvf <file_name>
		here, xvf stands for
			x - extract
			v - notification that what have occured
			f - filename

C# vs .NET---

C# is a programming language, while .NET is a framework. It consists of a run-time environment (CLR) and a class library that we use for building applications.


CLR---

When you compile an application, C# compiler compiles your code to IL (Intermediate Language) code. IL code is platform agnostics, which makes it possible to a take a C# program on a different computer with different hardware architecture and operating system and run it. For this to happen, we need CLR. When you run a C# application, CLR compiles the IL code into the native machine code for the computer on which it is running. This process is called Just-in-time Compilation (JIT).


Architecture of .NET Applications---

In terms of architecture, an application written with C# consists of building blocks called classes. A class is a container for data (attributes) and methods (functions). Attributes represent the state of the application. Methods include code. They have logic. That's where we implement our algorithms and write code.
A namespace is a container for related classes. So as your application grows in size, you may want to group the related classes into various namespaces for better maintainability.
As the number of classes and namespaces even grow further, you may want to physically separate related namespaces into separate assemblies. An assembly is a file (DLL or EXE) that contains one or more namespaces and classes. An EXE file represents a program that can be executed. A DLL is a file that includes code that can be re-used across different programs.

Jitter: Jitter is defined as a variation in the delay of received packets. The sending side transmits packets in a continuous stream and spaces them evenly apart. Because of network congestion, improper queuing, or configuration errors, the delay between packets can vary instead of remaining constant.This variation causes problems for audio playback at the receiving end. Playback may experience gaps while waiting for the arrival of variable delayed packets.

to identify the port is running or not in windows use following command:
    netstat -an | find "port_number"

to identify the pid of the specified port in windows we use following command:
	netstat -a -o -n | finstr 0.0:8080

to kill the port which is being used in windows use following command:
	taskkill /F /PID portnumber
	
to identify the active connections:
	netstat -anb

Application Execution:
1.)	IL(Intermediate Language) is also known as MSIL(Microsoft Intermediate Language),CIL(common intermediate language),Managed Code
2.)	Assemblies have an extension of .dll or .exe depending on application type.
3.)	.Net assembly contains IL(Managed Code) where as pre .Net assembly contain Native Code(Machine Code, Unmanaged Code).
4.)	.Net application execution consists of 2 steps:
	a) compilation - source code to IL
	b) execution or JIT compilation  - IL to Platform specific native code 
5.) CLR(Common Language Runtime) - .Net runtime environment provides several benefits such as garbage collection.
6.)	Native code is not stored permanently anywhere, after we close the program the native code is thrown away.

Javascript vs Jscript.Net
JScript is just the Microsoft's version of JavaScript. But in some situations JScript is not behaving like JavaScript. 
For Example: 
		Declare a variable called temp in JavaScript code and create a object within the page having the field id as "temp".
								var temp = 'Hello';
		try to set the value of object temp in the page to the value of variable temp.
								document.getElementById('temp').innerHTML = temp;
		In here, JavaScript is working fine, but the JScript gives a error.The reason behind this is, in here JScript does not recognize the difference between var temp and document.getElementById('temp'). So he treats as both of them are referring to one single object. But JavaScript recognises the temp variable and the object within the page having id "temp" as two entirely separate fields. So that is a one significant difference between JavaScript and JScript. Another one is JScript supports additional commands that allow access to ActiveX and the local computer when comparing to JavaScript. But these commands are intended for use on intranet sites and for the browser Internet Explorer.

LINQ queries have two different behaviors of execution : 
	1. Deferred execution(Lazy Operators) : -  These query operators use deferred execution. Examples - select, where, Take, Skip etc. LINQ Query is only defined 	at point where it is written and is not executed at the point when it was used.

	 // LINQ Query is only defined here and is not executed at this point
         // If the query is executed at this point, the result should not display Tim

	IEnumerable<Student> result = from student in listStudents where student.TotalMarks == 800 select student;
 	
	listStudents.Add(new Student { StudentID = 104, Name = "Tim", TotalMarks = 800 });
	
	// The above query is actually executed when we iterate thru the sequence
        // using the foreach loop. This is proved as Tim is also included in the result
	foreach (Student s in result)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(s.StudentID + "\t" + s.Name + "\t" + s.TotalMarks);
        }

	2. Immediate execution(Greedy Operators) : - These query operators use immediate execution. Examples - count, average, min, max, ToList etc. LINQ Query is 	executed immediately at the point where it was written.


	 // Since we are using ToList() which is a greedy operator
         // the LINQ Query is executed immediately at this point
         IEnumerable<Student> result = (from student in listStudents where student.TotalMarks == 800 select student).ToList();

	// Adding a new student object with TotalMarks = 800 to the source
        // will have no effect on the result as the query is already executed
        listStudents.Add(new Student { StudentID = 104, Name = "Tim", TotalMarks = 800 });

	// The above query is executed at the point where it is defined.
        // This is proved as Tim is not included in the result
        foreach (Student s in result)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(s.StudentID + "\t" + s.Name + "\t" + s.TotalMarks);
        }

ToArray :- 
ToArray operator extracts all of the items from the source sequence and returns a new Array. This operator causes the query to be executed immediately. This operator does not use deferred execution.

ToDictionary :- 
ToDictionary operator extracts all of the items from the source sequence and returns a new Dictionary. This operator causes the query to be executed immediately. This operator does not use deferred execution.

ToLookUp  :- 
This is just like a dictionary, a Lookup is a collection of key/value pairs. A dictionary cannot contain keys with identical values, where as a Lookup can.

Cast  :-
It convert all of the items within an existing collection to another type and return them in a new collection. If an item fails conversion an exception will be thrown. This method uses deferred execution. Cast operator will try to cast all the elements in the collection into the specified type. If some of the items fail conversion, InvalidCastException will be thrown.
We would generally use Cast when the following 2 conditions are met: 
1. We want to cast all the items in the collection &
2. We know for sure the collection contains only elements of the specified type.

OfType  :-
It will return only elements of the specified type. The other type elements are simply ignored and excluded from the result set. OfType operator returns only the elements of the specified type and the rest of the items in the collection will be ignored and excluded from the result. 
We would generally use OfType when we want to filter the elements and return only the ones of the specified type.

Stored Procedure:

In DBMS Stored Procedure is denoted by SP. It is a set of Structured Query Language i.e. (SQL). They are stored in database server (SQL Server). Stored procedure is a group of Transact-SQL statements which performs one or more specific task in a single execution plan. There are 3 different types of SP's : 

1. System SP's - It is stored in master database (pre-fixed "sp_") and usually perform the task for sql server functions.
2. User Defined SP's - These custom SP's are created by user for implementing certain task in their applications (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and SELECT)
3. Extended SP's - Depreciated (No longer in USE)

Types of parameter available in SP:

Input Parameter : We can pass any number of input parameters to SP function.
Output Parameter : We can output any number of output parameters from SP function.
Return Parameter : But we can return only one/single return parameter from SP function.
