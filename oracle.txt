Oracle always store rows inside a block.
Number of rows stored in the block are determined my the factor including : 
	1) size of the block(default=8k)
	2) number of columns 
	3) their data types in the table

FTS(Full table scan) :  pick several blocks at once, in what oracle calls an multi block read
Index Range Scan : picking up one block at a time, going from my document.

FTS does a constant amount of work, where as index range scan  will do an amount of work that is proportional to the number of rows that it has to access.

Oracle tracks how well the order entries are in an index, relative to how they were physically stored in the table by the clustering factor
