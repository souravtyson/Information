Steps to install jenkins on ubuntu : 

a) wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
b) sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
c) sudo apt-get update
d) sudo apt-get install jenkins


After running jenkins as a service if you are not able to start the service using command : 
                                         
										 sudo service jenkins start 
										 
then check the logs at /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log. If you find the error related to port being used then you have to chnage the default port on which jenkins listen.
You can do that by changing the config file present at /etc/default/jenkins location.

After doing that jenkins will  ask for the credentials at ui interface. You have to provide credentials present in this file : /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
