Steps to install jenkins on ubuntu : 

a) wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
b) sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
c) sudo apt-get update
d) sudo apt-get install jenkins


After running jenkins as a service if you are not able to start the service using command : 
                                         
										 sudo service jenkins start 
										 
then check the logs at /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log. If you find the error related to port being used then you have to chnage the default port on which jenkins listen.
You can do that by changing the config file present at /etc/default/jenkins location.

After doing that jenkins will  ask for the credentials at ui interface. You have to provide credentials present in this file : /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword



How to add plugins in jenkins - 
Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Available(Tab)


After installing the github plugin
On dashboard page of jenkins click
net item -> free-style project and provide project name 
Click ok
this will redirect you to next page where you fill all the details related to github
select source code management (tab) - > git (place the clone url of the repository can be found on the github page)
then go to build triggers (tab) - select github hook trigger for GITScm polling option
now click on save


this is one part of the configuration the another part is a workaroundas out jenkins is not accessed via internet. For that we will use ngrok utility which will bind my ip and port to internet.

ngrok.exe http 8081

this will make my jenkins accessible on internet.
