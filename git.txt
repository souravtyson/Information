add changes to git :

Git is based on distributed control system
Git is the industry-standard version control system for web developers

Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:

git init - creates a new Git repository
git status - inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
git add . - adds files from the working directory to the staging area
git diff - shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
git commit - permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
git log - shows a list of all previous commits
git branch - Lists all a Git project's branches.
git branch branch_name - Creates a new branch.
git checkout branch_name - Used to switch from one branch to another.
git merge branch_name - Used to join file changes from one branch to another.
git branch -d branch_name - Deletes the branch specified.
git clone remote_location clone_name - 

	In this command - 
		remote_location - tells Git where to go to find the remote. This could be a web address, or a filepath.
		clone_name - is the name you give to the directory in which Git will clone the repository.
		One thing that Git does behind the scenes when you clone 'remote_location' is, give the remote address the name 'origin', so that you can refer to it more conveniently. It is possible to safely change its name

git clone: Creates a local copy of a remote.
git remote -v: Lists a Git project's remotes.
git fetch: Fetches work from the remote into the local copy.
git merge origin/master: Merges origin/master into your local branch.
git push origin <branch_name>: Pushes a local branch to the origin remote.
